            Cake, in general, any of a variety of breads, shortened or unshortened, shaped by the tin in which it is baked, or, more specifically, a sweetened bread, often rich or delicate. In the codified cuisine of France,all cakes, or gâteaux, derive from one of eight basic doughs: short pastry, flake pastry, sweet pastry, savarin, brioche, baba, chou pastry, and genoise.

Chiffon cake is made by a modification of the muffin method in which the egg white is beaten separately and blended with the other mixed ingredients.Shortened cakes made by these methods can be baked in flat layer pans, in loaf pans, or in individual cups and can be baked at oven temperatures of 350–400 °F (177–204 °C).
